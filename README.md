# gistemp
Visualization of Goddard Institute Surface Temperature (GISTEMP) data as an estimate of global surface temperature change.

## Purpose
This project is an exercise in producing plots and visualizing data using the [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) package in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Source of data
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies web site for GISS Surface Temperature Analysis ([GISTEMP](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)) provides "data files from NOAA GHCN v3 (meteorological stations), ERSST v4 (ocean areas), and SCAR (Antarctic stations)". Plots in this project are based on the "Tables of Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means".
